question 3 

First, we used our function f(x) = ln(x+1) to solve the differential equations initial value problem, which was (dy/dx) = f(x)*(1-y), y(0) = 2.
As you can see in the equations above, we found the constant and then took the derivative of y. After, we created an algorithm to perform Euler's method.
Then, using Euler's method we created a graph which shows are results. Next, we created an algorithm to perform Runge-Kutta's 4th order method.
We used the algorithm to find three different solutions on a given interval and graphed the three different solution. Lastly, we computed the errors and created a table for our results.
Our numerical methods worked, because we took inputs in for both methods and outputed solutions for both methods.
